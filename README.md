We explore the learning dynamics of agents engaging in a karma economy as described in the following paper:
Elokda, Ezzat, et al. "A self-contained karma economy for the dynamic allocation of common resources." arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.00495 (2022).

Possible Learning Methods:
- Reinforcement Learning: DDPG, Actor Critic
- Ficticious Play
- Experience Weighted Attraction
